	<h1>What does your character’s environment sound like: Do they have folk songs, dances or rituals? Do they live alone quietly in the wild? Are they living in a crowded city? What are the weather conditions? Describe the sounds they hear in their daily life. </h1>
	<p>Rainmark’s environment, Outcast Island, is kind of a mixed of civilized and barbaric culture. Where about half of the Outcasters would look out for one another and the half live like their surviving a world war. The weather is usually fair for the islanders, including clear skies and sunny days, but not when there’s sea storm or hurricane coming around the corner. The sounds that can be heard from Outcast Island are the sounds of either laughing from the childern or screams of horror wither depending which day of the week it is.</p>
