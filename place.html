	<h1>What imaginary place does your character originate from, describe it and say why it is special?   </h1>
<p>The imaginary place that Rainmark originates from is Outcast Island. Now, this island is no ordinary island, no, it’s home to individuals that we’re born differently compared to other people in the world, with bazar looks and freaky abilities that even modern science can not answer.  </p>
