	<h1>What are Rainmark's physical traits and abilities?  </h1>
<p>Rainmark’s physical traits are that he can walk, talk, and can do just about anything that any other human being can do, but he does have the ability to summon and ride on rainbows, take any object and steals it color to convert it into energy leaving it black and white, and can manipulate a person’s emotions just by touching him or her.  </p>
